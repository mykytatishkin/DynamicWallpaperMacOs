Don`t forget to change way to your wallpaper in script by editing next lines
```sh
light_wallpaper="Users/mykytatishkin/Downloads/WALLP/day.jpg"
dark_wallpaper="Users/mykytatishkin//Downloads/WALLP/night.jpg"
```

To launch script, by writing `cd directory` find same directory as your file and then write
`sh wallpaper.sh`

**DONT CLOSE TERMINAL - SCRIPT WILL STOP**

UPD: If Terminal window irretates you, create another desktop and send this window to it.
